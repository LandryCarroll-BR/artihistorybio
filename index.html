    <p class="from-me">Happy 2121! Even though online classes aren't my preference, I'm happy to be back in school this
      semester nonetheless. Let's hope this year turns out to be better than the last.</p>

    <p class="from-them">What's your major?</p>
    <p class="from-me">I am in the process of completing the AA/LT (Associate of Arts/Louisiana Transfer) degree to
      transfer to LSU to complete a BFA with a concentration in Graphic Design and a computer science minor.</p>
    <p class="from-them">Cool. What are your interests?</p>

    <p class="from-me">As an enneagram 5 with a notably heavy 4 wing, I generally enjoy anything that involves thinking
      and/or creating. My personal interests include design, programming, and philosophy.</p>
    <p class="from-them">Nice. Where are you from?</p>
    <p class="from-me">I am originally from Alexandria, Louisiana. However, I've spent most of my life in Walker,
      Louisiana.</p>
    <p class="from-them">Great. What do you want to learn from this class?</p>
    <p class="from-me">Learning to identify the relationship between culture and art particularly interests me.</p>
    <p class="from-them">Okay. What did you learn from quarantine?</p>
    <p class="from-me">During the quarantine, I've learned to take advantage of every ounce of time during the day. As
      life gets busier, being able to manage oneâ€™s time is critical to sanity.</p>
    <p class="from-me">Thanks for reading.</p>
